Project Overview: This project aims to predict patient readmission within 30 days using a machine learning model. The dataset includes patient information such as demographics, medical history, and hospital readmission records. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to readmissions and improve healthcare management.

Skills Developed:

 - Data preprocessing: Loading and cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and relationships using various plots (e.g., histograms, box plots, and heatmaps) to gain insights into patient     demographics and medical history.
 - Feature Engineering: Creating new features and selecting relevant ones to improve model performance.
 - Model Development: Implementing and tuning machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost) to predict patient readmission.
-  Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Implementing cross-validation to ensure model robustness.

Technology Used:

 - Python programming language
 - Libraries and tools:
   - NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
   - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
   - Scikit-learn and XGBoost for machine learning
   - Jupyter Notebook for the development environment
 
Use Case: 
The use case involves healthcare providers using the predictive model to identify patients at high risk of readmission. By understanding the factors influencing readmissions, healthcare providers can develop targeted interventions and personalized care plans to reduce readmission rates. This can lead to improved patient outcomes, enhanced quality of care, and reduced healthcare costs.
